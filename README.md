# Task Manager CLI App

## ðŸ“š Purpose

This project is a simple **Command Line Interface (CLI)** application for managing tasks, built entirely in **Java 8+**.  

The goal is to simulate a basic task management system that allows users to:
- Add new tasks
- View all tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Sort tasks by due date
- View only incomplete tasks (with future CLI upgrades planned)

âœ… The application is **fully unit-tested** using **JUnit 5** to ensure reliability and correctness.
